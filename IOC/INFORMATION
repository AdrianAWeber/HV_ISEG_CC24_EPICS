The Network of the CRATE is per default : 

	IP-Adres: 192.168.2.1
	Netmask : 255.255.255.0
	Gateway : 0.0.0.0


The Browser Login:

	Username:  admin
	Password:  password


The 2 .db files and the substituition file must be uploaded to the Crate. Therefore use the Browser LogIn and use iCSconfig. 
Later it should be possible to connect via ssh (ISEG will develope this).
